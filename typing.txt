Over the last few years, the internet has become extremely cheap and available for the majority of the population of developed and developing countries leading to more people being online and using such services.
I strongly agree that as more people are sharing their details online their right to privacy is diminishing.



Firstly,social media has become very popular and prevalent among young people.Most of them who are very involved in social media applications tend to share details about their daily lives which can 
include their place of study, residence and sometimes details of their family members. Consequently anyone who has access to social media accounts of such people will be able to see that information.
In this way people are losing their right to privacy.With more people getting access to such information one cannot have private life.



On the other hand,some people argue that now developers are creating ways to have more privacy online,like hiding sensitive information such as contact numbers,address etc.But it is still up to the user to make 
sure they do not set their details to public access.



Futhermore,there are services other than social media like delivery services online consulting services where the user gives out their addresses and other 
sensitive information.While the user expects the company to keep their data private,sometimes companies sell this data to third 
party companies.In this way many users are losing their right to privacy.



To summarise,as people are sharing their personal details online,their right to privacy is eroding and the reasond mentioned above support my standpoint.
